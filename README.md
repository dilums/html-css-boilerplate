# HTML & CSS Boilerplate

A simple webpack-based boilerplate for quickly setting up HTML and SCSS projects with hot reloading. Perfect for basic HTML/CSS testing, prototypes, and small projects.

## Features

- Webpack for bundling
- SCSS support
- Hot reloading with webpack-dev-server
- Basic HTML template included

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dilums/html-css-boilerplate.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd html-css-boilerplate
npm install
```

3. Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

The development server will open your default browser, and you can start working on your project. Any changes made to the HTML or SCSS files will automatically trigger a refresh.

4. To build your project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` folder.
